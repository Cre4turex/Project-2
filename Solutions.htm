  <h2> Renewable Energy </h2>
  <p>
    Solar power is essentially carbon-free. A small amount of pollution is created during the manufacturing process,
    and disposal is an ongoing challenge; however, the fuel used (the sun) is free, is plentiful, and doesn't pollute.
    Wind turbines harness air currents and convert them to emissions-free power. Renewable energy isn’t just limited to the sun or wind.
    Geothermal plants gather heat from the earth to generate steam and produce electricity. Hydroelectric dams exploit the movement of
    water to turn turbines. New hydrokinetic technologies harness the power of ocean’s currents and tides. And bioenergy—the burning of
    biomass to generate power—may offer a sustainable use for crops and waste wood.<br><br>

The key thing tying all of these technologies together is their ability to create electricity with minimal harmful side-effects.
The alternatives are neither sustainable nor safe.<br><br>

  <h2> Politics </h2>
  <p>
    Every day, decisions are made that affect all of us—laws, regulations, and other policy choices that have the
    potential to make our communities safer, healthier, fairer, and better prepared for a challenging future. <br><br>

If these decisions are to be practical and effective, they must be grounded in evidence. If they are to be just
and equitable, everyone in the community must have a voice in their making. Thus science and democracy are indispensable
partners in ensuring that public decisions serve the public interest. <br><br>

But the public interest doesn’t necessarily align with the interests of the powerful. As a result, science and democracy
are often targeted by those who see their bottom lines or political power at stake. These attacks do real harm when they
succeed—and those of us already carrying the heaviest burdens, communities of color and people living in poverty, suffer most.<br><br>

The Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists works for strong, independent public science,
a robust, transparent democracy, justice for overburdened communities, and the effective use of science in making
policy that serves the common good.<br><br>
