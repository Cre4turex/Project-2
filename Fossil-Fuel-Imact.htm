  <h2> Coal </h2>
  <p> The United States has burned coal for over 100 years. Most of it is mined either deep underground,
    from the tops of mountains, or in expansive open-surface mines in the American West. <br><br>

But America’s long history with coal shouldn’t be romanticized. More than 100,000 people have died
in American coal mines—more than the number of servicemen lost in the Korean and Vietnam wars combined.
Countless others suffer from its debilitating health effects; worldwide coal causes more deaths than natural disasters,
homicide, road accidents, and measles combined. Until recently, it also was the single largest source of US carbon pollution.<br><Br>
</p>
</div>

<div class="fu">
  <h2> Natural Gas </h2>
  <p> For most of the twentieth century, natural gas played a relatively minor role in the US power sector.
     But with the rise fracking and horizontal drilling in the early 2000s, natural gas took off, with serious
     implications for the climate. When leaked into the atmosphere, the main ingredient in natural gas—methane—acts
     as a potent heat-trapping gas. When burnt, it releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants.<br><br>

As such, natural gas has a very limited role to play in the clean energy economy. It burns more cleanly than coal,
and makes the transition away from coal easier and quicker. But investing in natural gas brings its own economic
and safety risks, and won’t bring the emissions reductions we need.<br><Br>

<div class="fu">
  <h2> Oil </h2>
  <p> While not widely used in the power sector, oil is used for energy, in the form of gasoline,
    diesel, and jet fuel. It’s incredibly dirty: transportation is the largest source of carbon
    pollution in the United States and a major cause of asthma, bronchitis, and certain cancers.<br><br>

Oil companies are also some of the most active and vocal opponents of climate action in the world.
ExxonMobil and others have spread climate disinformation for decades, while funding groups that
fight against efforts to curb carbon emissions.<br><Br>

    margin-bottom: 0px;"> Texas Faces Chronic Inundation </h2>
  <p style= "margin-bottom:20px;">In Texas and all along the US coastline, many cities and towns will experience high-tide
    flooding within the next few decades that will be chronic and extensive enough to force difficult choices.
    Because this persistent flooding can render neighborhoods, commercial districts, industrial zones, and recreational
    and other areas unusable, communities will face either major coastal defense investments or the prospect of retreat
     from affected places. <br><br>
Coordinated action by households, local and state leadership, and businesses is required. Federal resources and policymakers’
decisions will help determine whether coastal communities are resilient an continue to thrive. And even as the Trump administration
seeks to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, we must work at state and local levels and with other nations to cut global warming
emissions aggressively in order to help slow the pace of sea level rise.<br><br></p>
